 * <p>The abstract class Expression provides the root of a class hierarchy used to model expression trees.</p>
 * <p>The classes in this package that derive from Expression, for example MemberExpression and ParameterExpression, are used to represent nodes in an expression tree.
 * The Expression class contains static factory methods to create expression tree nodes of the various types.</p>
 * <p>The enumeration type ExpressionType specifies the unique node types.</p>
